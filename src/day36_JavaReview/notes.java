Java Review: ArrayList ( all methods)
             ArrayList & loop
             Constructors
package: day36_JavaReview
WarmUp:
    1. write a return method that can remove the duplicated objects from an Integer arraylist
    2. write a return method that can remove the duplicated objects from a String arraylist
    3. write a return method that can remove the duplicated objects from a Character arraylist
    4. write a return method that can remove the duplicated objects from a Double arraylist
ArrayList methods: add(), get(), clear(), set(), size(),  indexOf(), 
                    lastIndexOf(), remove(), equals(), contains(),
                    Array.asList(), addAll(), removeAll()
Constructors: special method, used when we create an object of a class
            Every class MUST have constructor.
            if we don't create any constructor, then compiler will give default (no-arg) constructor
creating object:
        ClassName obj = new  ExistingConstructor;
        only the givenm given constructor gets executed
decleration of constructor:
        default constructor:
            access-modifier  className(){
            }
        
        constrcutor with arg:
            access-modifier  className(parameter){
            }
            constructor's name MUST be same with class name
            in constructor's method signature, there is no return type and specifier
            we can create multiple constructors by overloading the constructor
            we can give multiple parameters in the constructor
constructor calls: 
        1. only a constructor can call another constructor
        2. constructor cannot called by constructor name
        3. we use "this()" keyword to call the constructor in currect class
        4. constructor call MUST be the first step in a constructor
        5. one constructor can only call one constructor (cannot call more than 1)
        6. constructor cannot call it self
        7. constructor cannot contain itself
this keyword: used for calling object instances (anything that belongs to the object)
topics: instance methods, instance variables, class variables
