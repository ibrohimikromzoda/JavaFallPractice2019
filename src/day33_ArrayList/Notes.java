Topics: Method calls (layered fashion)
        ArrayList
        ArrayList vs Array
package: day33_ArrayList
Today's agenda:
                Morning: Java
                Afternoon: Java
Warm up:
    write a return method that accepts an int array and sorts it in descending order
    write a return method that accepts a double array and sorts it in descending order
    write a return method that accepts a char array and sorts it in descending order
    write a return method that accepts a String array and sorts it in descending order
        Hint: method overloading is prefered here
ArrayList:  presented in "java.util"
            does not support primitives, we can only store objects
            ArrayList' size is dynamic, adjusted automatically.
            ArrayList is an ordered collection of values (index number).
            we can add or remove objects from arrayList
        
decleration of ArrayList:
        ArrayList<NonPrimitive> variableName = new  ArrayList<NonPrimitive>();
        ArrayList<NonPrimitive> variableName = new  ArrayList<>();  (prefered)
decleration of array:
                int[] arr = new int[5];
methods of arraylist:
        add(object): adds objects to arrayList
        get(index):  gets the data from the arraylist
        size(): rteurns the length of arraylist as int
        clear(): remeovs everything from arraylist
        set(index number, object): the given object will replace the object at the given index number
        contains(Object): checks if the given object is contained in the ArrayList or not, returns boolean values
        equal(ArrayList): checks if the two arrayList have same objects or not, returns boolean value
        remove(int): removes the given index
        remove(object) :  removes the first matching object, and retruns boolean value
ArrayList vs Array:
    ArrayList' size is dynamic, Array' size is fixed
    ArrayList only supports nonprimitives, Array supports all
    Array can nbe multi-dimensional but ArrayList cannot be multi-dimensional
tomorrow:
        indexOf, remeovaALl, addAll,
        converting array to arrayList , Collections.sort
